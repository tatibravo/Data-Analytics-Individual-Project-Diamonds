# Data-Analytics-Individual-Project-Diamonds
For this project, the objective was to analyze data regarding diamonds and look for patterns, utilizing charts and graphs (heat map, scatter plot, bar chart, and violin plot).
I looked at the correlation between carat and price (positive correlation), correlation between the X, Y, and Z dimensions and price (all positive correlations), color and price (no strong correlation, although colors J and H had higher prices than the rest, especially D, which is deemed the worst color), and clarity and price. Higher prices for I1, SI1 and SI2 does not indicate strong correlation with price and quality, although VS1 and VS2 having higher prices is would be a positive correlation. It's surprising that  IF diamonds (which have no inclusions) are not highly priced, even though they are considered higher quality than I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, and VS2.
